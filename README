DESCRIPTION AND SPECS

Yo So this is a small project to make so I can use Zbrush and CSP with a better bluetooth than the one I got from Huion. 
Could also make it look p nice with mechanical switches. But all that increases cost and is not essential atm. We'll see.

PROJECT AIM

- Keypad with bluetooth connectivity
- USB 3.0 setup for connection establishment and charging
- Between 18 and 26 Keys which is enough for any CSP function or Zbrush brush I use normally. 
- Way to switch between software program key assignment (hardware or software?) 
- No larger than a TI-83 Calculator, and thin as possible. 
- Decals and colors to help denote functions

OPTIONAL BUT FUN IDEAS :D      * = priority wants

- Backlit possibly RGB compatible
- Mechanical Switches *
- Casing made of wood or metal 
- Keys elevated various heights to help aid blind pressing
- Enough keys to function as a one-handed second keyboard 
- A button that mutes the microphone for streams *
- A zoom and brush mod control for sizing ( play around with methods of tactile sensor control ) *
- Controls for zbrush: "Z-intensity" and "Focus" *
- Controls for CSP: Brush size and Opacity  *
- Controls for CSP: Switch to layer above or below
- Macro controls also for Blender
